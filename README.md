# cypress b√°sico v2
Sample project to introduce Cypress.

# Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v18.21.1 and 8.19.2 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

# Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

# Tests
You can run tests simulating a desktop or a mobile viewport.

# Desktop
Run 'npm run test' (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run 'npm run cy:open' to open Cypress in a interective mode on a desktop viewport.

# Mobile
Run 'npm run test:mobile' to run the test  in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run 'npm run cy:open:mobile' to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.
